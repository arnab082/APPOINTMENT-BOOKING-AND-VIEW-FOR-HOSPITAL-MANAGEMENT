# LIFE WAVES

The project aims to develop an online healthcare portal to facilitate easy booking of medicines, doctors in times of emergency, monitor health and get alerts on possible health complications. We aim to develop an online platform to facilitate our users in the life cycle of healthcare. The portal would serve as a one-stop solution to book, schedule and view appointments.

## Conclusion and Future work

- Provide easy access to top-notch medical services to every individual
- Reduce the stigma around medical security
- Reduce the overall deaths due to negligence and ignorance. Also the deaths caused due to health conditions one terms as a ‘temporary phenomenon’ but ends up being more serious than they anticipated
- Generate data that shall help further medical studies and help improve the knowledge medical professionals have. This shall help improve the overall quality of medical services
- Create a large network of connected medical personnel to be able to provide near instant help to the people who require medical attention
- Provide transparent medical data to the users without tampering or hiding any data. In the present world, we give up a lot of information but there is no way for us to know what data we have given up. We intend to have a transparent model, thus providing all the information we collect back to the user for their knowledge and maintenance.
